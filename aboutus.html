        <p class="slogan">
            FindRes was founded in 2025 in Bloemfontein with the goal of solving a 
            growing challenge faced by students — finding safe, affordable, and 
            convenient accommodation near their institutions. 
            What started as a small initiative has grown into a trusted platform 
            connecting hundreds of students to verified residences across the country.
